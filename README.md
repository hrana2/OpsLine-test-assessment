# OpsLine Test Assessment

This website displays alert data in a user friendly and easy to read format by using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). 
I utilized the Cards component to neatly organize each alert and the Accordian component to display the description, solution, and evidence text. 
Cards allow the user to distinguish between the different alerts and using the Accordian component displays large amounts of text in a compact form to save space so the user is not bombarded with paragraphs of text. 
The color palette is drawn from the OpsLine logo and uses "#02366c" for the banner and "#7dcde2" for the background of the card body. The only diveance from this color palette is the red used to highlight the severity level of each alert which brings the user's attention to the importance of each alert.
